      <Text><![CDATA[<B>&#39;I love&#160;deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.&#39; So said author Douglas Adams - but what if there was a way of making deadlines work for you and using them to ensure others provide you with what you want when you want it?</B><BR><BR> In Christopher Cox&#39;s brilliant new book, he looks at the impact deadlines have on us, and how we can use them to deliver the best results for all parties. Social scientists have revealed that most negotiations run right up to the deadline before a deal is finally struck. What they also discovered was that this deadline effect usually results in a worse deal for both parties. Cox shows you how, instead, the deadline effect can be used to bring about success not failure.<BR><BR> The truth is that most of us think of deadlines all wrong. They aren&rsquo;t immutable laws of nature; they are a game we can play - and win. This book will show you the strategies different workplaces have come up with to do just that. They are the businesses and individuals who are rehabilitating the deadline effect, taking the urgency it provides and jettisoning all the down-to-the-wire nonsense. Based on his own experience as a magazine commissioning editor, where coaxing writers to deliver on time is an art form, he also embeds himself in other businesses, such as a ski patrol ahead of the first day of the winter season, to see how they meet deadlines that cannot be missed.&#160;<BR><BR><B>Above all, this book is an argument to embrace the power of deadlines. When time is limited, people are less wasteful, more focused, productive and creative. It&rsquo;s a liberating realisation: excellence and timeliness are not at odds, and the deadline effect can be highly effective.</B><BR><BR> &#160;]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[&#39;Cox is a zealous proselytiser of &quot;the deadline effect&quot; - the transformative work that happens at the eleventh hour... It&#39;s only by mentally manipulating ourselves to act early and often that we can ever do spectacular things... Though Cox may have learned his tricks as a deadline enforcer, he knows better than to preach without practice.&#39;]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[&#39;Christopher Cox is highly lucid and a quick learner, who also happens to be skilled at explaining big ideas through stories. The examples are <b>wildly various and creative</b>, and each features high stakes: will the Easter lilies be ready to ship on time? Will the new restaurant open on schedule? Will the box store be prepared for the crush of Black Friday? A <b>wry and literate</b> how-to, a counterphobic look at the deadlines we fear yet couldn&rsquo;t live without.&#39;]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[Georges Salines lost his daughter Lola in the attack on the Bataclan Theatre in Paris on 13th November 2015.&#160; Azdyne Amimour lost his son.&#160; Both were aged 28.&#160; &#160;Lola was one of the 90 victims, Amimour&#39;s son one of the attackers.<BR> &#160;<BR> From his meeting with Azdyne Amimour, an unprecedented dialogue emerged. Georges Salines carries the memory of his daughter and many other victims, while Azdyne Amimour seeks to understand how his son was able to commit acts which he condemns without appeal. Driven by mutual curiosity, the two tell their stories and unfold the story of &#39;their&#39; 13th November.<BR> &#160;<BR> In the course of this conversation, a deep respect was born between these two fathers whom everything should nevertheless have opposed. Their testimony feeds a peaceful reflection on radicalization, education and mourning. Because if there are words left, there is also hope.<BR> &#160;]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[In this memoir, iconic singer Linda Ronstadt weaves together a captivating story of her origins in Tucson, Arizona, and her rise to stardom in the Southern California music scene of the 1960s and &#8216;70s.<BR><BR>Tracing the timeline of her remarkable life, Linda Ronstadt, whose forty-five year career has encompassed a wide array of musical styles, weaves together a captivating story of her origins in Tucson, Arizona, and her rise to stardom in the Southern California music scene of the 1960s and &#8216;70s.<BR><BR>Linda Ronstadt was born into a musical family, and her childhood was filled with everything from Gilbert and Sullivan to Mexican folk music to jazz and opera. Her artistic curiosity blossomed early, and she and her siblings began performing their own music for anyone who would listen. Now, in this beautifully crafted memoir, Ronstadt tells the story of her wide-ranging and utterly unique musical journey. <BR><BR>Ronstadt arrived in Los Angeles just as the folkrock movement was beginning to bloom, setting the stage for the development of country-rock. As part of the coterie of like-minded artists who played at the famed Troubadour club in West Hollywood, she helped define the musical style that dominated American music in the 1970s. One of her early backup bands went on to become the Eagles, and Linda went on to become the most successful female artist of the decade. <BR><BR>In <I>Simple Dreams</I>, Ronstadt reveals the eclectic and fascinating journey that led to her long-lasting success, including stories behind many of her beloved songs. And she describes it all in a voice as beautiful as the one that sang &#8220;Heart Like a Wheel&#8221;&#8212;longing, graceful, and authentic.]]></Text>

They channel divine love and embrace sexuality freely, practicing polyamory, sexual healing, and even sex magic. They teach tantra, trance dance, kundalini yoga, and other techniques for healing shame, guilt, fear, and sexual trauma. <BR><BR>Designed to guide the reader on a journey into their own sacred sexual awakening, this book shares true stories from 20 visionary pioneers in the sexual shamanism movement, all of them associated with the International School of Temple Arts (ISTA), a mystery school that works to illuminate the path of sexual shamanism and heal the split between sex and spirit, release the shame surrounding sexual awakening, and inspire more sexual liberation around the world. The teachers reveal intimate details of their life stories and sexual awakening journeys, showing how, by surrendering to the wisdom of the erotic current of the universe, transformation occurs. <BR><BR>Each story is accompanied by an in-depth embodiment exercise with step-by-step instructions, including soul gazing, contacting your spirit guides, sexual divination, energetic sex, self-pleasuring, moon blood rituals, and sacred sexual storytelling. Underlying these exercises is the belief that the body is a temple that opens with pleasurable worship so spirit may dwell more fully within. <BR><BR>The 20 contributors include Baba Dez Nichols, Bruce Lyon, Crystal Dawn Morris, Dawn Cherie, Deborah Taj Anapol, Ellie Wilde, Janine Ma-Ree, KamalaDevi McClure, Komala Lyra, Laurie Handlers, Lin Holmquist, Matooka Moonbear, Mia Mor, Ohad Pele Ezrahi, Patrik Olterman, Raffaello Manacorda, Ria Bloom, Sean O&rsquo;Faolain, Stephanie Phillips, and Stephen SouLove.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 5. Queen of the Underworld</B> <BR><BR>by Dawn Cherie Ezrahi <BR><BR>I'm fascinated by myth and ritual. In some ways, you could say that it guides my life. If you really want to know my journey into sexual shamanism, you must recall the myth of Persephone.<BR><BR>Persephone&rsquo;s descent has many interpretations, most commonly that she was abducted against her will, raped, and tricked into eating the fruit. However, the interpretation that I personally resonate with is not the one of victimhood, but rather empowerment. It&rsquo;s about a woman who needed to go to the Underworld to claim her dark wisdom and divinity. <BR><BR>Whichever interpretation you chose, Persephone always represents fertility and the joy of life. Hades is often associated with Dionysus, hedonism, ecstatic abandon, and Bacchanalian revelry. I&rsquo;m irresistibly drawn to this myth because of my own eternal search for the ecstatic pulse and its hidden treasures. <BR><BR>My initial descent was in my late teens in New York City. As a runway model, I could have any sexual encounter I desired... I used my sensuality for power and freedom. I had more than my share of lovers, but always wanted something deeper and more connected and more inclusive of spirit. <BR><BR>After 9/11, the world seemed upside down, and I needed a drastic change. I felt called to dive deeper into the traditions of my ancestors. I was an actress in NYC, going on countless castings for commercials. I met a cute guy on the set of <I>Sex and the City</I>. I dragged him upstate to a freestyle dance, and as we spent the night together in the tent, my very Jewish grandpa came to me in a dream. I got a clear guidance to show up the next morning to the Jewish Renewal retreat center called Eilat Chayyim and at the last minute I decided I <I>must</I> enroll in the Prayer Leadership course. <BR><BR>I met Ohad on the Hebrew Valentine's Day of love, Tu B'Av, at the center. Ohad was invited there as a Rabbi, to teach the kabbalistic myth of &ldquo;The Lost Princess&rdquo;. He was a polyamorous, unconventional rabbi, the &ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; of the Jewish Renewal world. He had an iconic resemblance to Dionysius and he identified with him as well. He was the perfect combination of holy and naughty. His creativity spoke to my soul. Looking at him, I could feel my spirit craving and crying out for this inevitable coming together. Meeting Ohad was like walking into my destiny. It shook me to the core. <BR><BR>Later, at the dinner table with our mutual friends (who warned me about this polyamorous man), hearing that I was enrolled in the prayer leadership course, Ohad teased me, &ldquo;You know, in Hasidic mysticism, it is written that prayer is love-making with the Shekinah, the Divine feminine.&rdquo; It made sense to me. <BR><BR><I>Prayer is love-making as love-making is prayer. <BR></I><BR>It resonated as truth within my heart and body. I knew it all the time. By the end of the week, I also knew that this was one love I was not going to be able to turn away from. We both knew it, and yet through this apparent depth, we both knew it was not going to be a monogamous one. <BR><BR>An amazing thing happened when his Lingam entered me for the first time: I felt purified. I felt the sacredness of this act and of being cleansed from the inside, cleaning away the residual energy from insensitive lovers, from my past. <BR><BR>Never had I felt such sacredness, a purity, even innocence. The meeting of our energies at that particular time was electric. It felt like silk, like water in the desert. We were both thirsty for knowledge and experience; we drank each other in and devoured each other. <BR><BR>I remember making love before he returned to Israel. Challenges were waiting for him there, with his community. The priestess in me started to move. I was on top of him. As I sensed he was in deep realms of openness and surrender, I started to envision his trip back as an empowered journey and whispered it into his ears, planting the visions of trust and confidence in him as he went to face his challenges. Through the years, we developed and crystalized this method of sexual shamanism that showed itself from the depth of my intuitive knowing as ETP, Empowerment Through Pleasure. <BR><BR><B>EXERCISE #5: Sexual Divination</B> <BR><BR><B>PURPOSE:</B> In this exercise, your eros is used as a divination tool in place of a crystal ball, dowsing rod, or tea leaves. The symbols and signs that arise from your erotic trance are interpreted like dreams to vision future events, gain answers to difficult questions, or attain guidance. <BR><BR><B>PREPARATION:</B> Drink plenty of water to be hydrated for channeling energy. Set a sacred space with candles, incense, flowers, or/and any sacred objects that will aid your intuition, such as crystals or deities for your altar. Create a comfortable nest with blankets, pillows, lube, and your favorite sex toys. Take a ritual bath to prepare your body. You may choose to dress in special clothing if it helps remind you of your divinity. Play music that moves your spirit. <BR><BR><B>PROCESS:</B> Start by stretching and doing any emotional clearing needed so you are centered. Meditate. Make prayers and ask for guidance and clarity. Set your intention, and be sure it is in the highest good of all. Call in your spirit guides in whatever way is authentic and supportive to your soul. <BR><BR>Slowly begin the process of self-pleasuring. Start with slow long caresses, then vary your touch. Use movement, sound, and breath to activate the body. Touch yourself with the intention to connect to your higher self and source. Allow yourself to enter into an erotic trance and travel. Once consumed in pleasure allow yourself to receive images, colors, visions. Cry out to divinity, let your utterances be heard. Your visions are like dreams, they don&rsquo;t have to make sense. Let yourself flow.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[A deep investigation into historical documents that prove the notorious outlaw Jesse James faked his own death <BR><BR>&bull; Presents the legend of Jesse James and counters it with the real story, based on family records <BR><BR>&bull; Provides photographic evidence, a journal of Jesse James&rsquo;s, and historical records that prove James faked his death, verified by experts and civic authorities <BR><BR>&bull; Debunks the 1995 DNA test results of James&rsquo;s supposed remains <BR><BR>The story of the notorious outlaw Jesse James&rsquo;s assassination at the hands of Robert Ford has been clouded with mystery ever since its inception. Now, James&rsquo;s great-great-grandchildren Daniel and Teresa Duke present the results of more than 20 years of exhaustive research into state and federal records, photographs, newspaper reports, diaries, and a 1995 DNA test in search of the truth behind Jesse James&rsquo;s demise. <BR><BR>Explaining how the accepted version of the history of Jesse James is wrong, the authors confirm their family&rsquo;s oral tradition that James faked his own death in 1882 and lived out his remaining days in Texas. They methodically unravel the legend surrounding his death, with evidence vetted by qualified experts and civic authorities. They share the journal of their great-great-grandfather, kept from 1871 to 1876 and verified to be written in James&rsquo;s handwriting. They reveal forensically confirmed photographs of James before and after his supposed killing, including one of James attending his own funeral. Examining James&rsquo;s life both before and after his faked death, they provide an account of where he lived and who he associated with, including his interactions with secret societies. They compare the contradictory newspaper reports of James&rsquo;s death with accounts by his family and associates, which support that the man buried as James was actually his cousin, and reveal how James tricked authorities into believing he had been killed. <BR><BR>Further supporting their claim, the authors debunk the DNA test results of the exhumation of James&rsquo;s body in 1995. The Dukes detail the ways in which the test was fraudulent, an assertion supported by the deputy counselor for Clay County at the time of the testing. Backed by a wealth of evidence, the descendants of Jesse James conclusively prove what really happened to America&rsquo;s Robin Hood.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>From Chapter 1. A Legend Is Born</B> <BR><BR>Jesse James is a name recognized to this day by more people around the world than many other United States historical figures. Much of that is due, in our opinion, to the perfect combination of fact and myth. Jesse James was an outlaw to most, a hero to others, and to some, a terrorist. He has been the subject of Hollywood movies and scores of books. Jesse James, for better or worse, has captured the minds of the public around the world and holds them to this day, captivated at just the sound of his name. <BR><BR>How is it that a man, branded an outlaw could have had such a great impact on the minds of people around the globe for well over a century? Some say that so many people think of Jesse James as a folk hero because &ldquo;Jesse James represents every man who ever felt the boot of the Man on his neck.&rdquo; We also believe a large part of it has to do with a need for closure. Most people like to know what really happened. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the story relates to a good person or a bad person, a hero, outlaw, celebrity, or any public figure. Mystery is nice, but people like answers. They want the whole story and until they get an answer that satisfies them, they won&rsquo;t be satisfied, and neither will we. <BR><BR><B>From Chapter 2. Family Stories</B> <BR><BR>For as long as she could remember our late mother, Betty Dorsett Duke, had heard family stories that her paternal great-grandfather was really Jesse James. Her cousins had heard the same stories. The story goes that Jesse James left Missouri for Texas in 1871 using the alias of James Lafayette Courtney. The saddlebags on the horse he was riding and the one he was leading were full of gold. By October 31st he had married Mary Ellen Barron, daughter of Texas Ranger Captain Thomas Hudson Barron and settled down on a farm in Blevins, Falls County, Texas, which he purchased from his father-in-law, Captain Barron, with gold. He and Mary Ellen eventually had eight children, two boys and six girls, one of whom was Ida Florence &ldquo;Courtney,&rdquo; our great-grandmother. <BR><BR>Jesse James portrayed himself as James L. Courtney, an ex-Union Soldier who came to Texas after the Civil War and became an ordinary farmer. He was anything but ordinary. Ordinary farmers at that time didn&rsquo;t travel around with sacks full of gold. Gold was scarce in those days and even more so for ordinary farmers. Some of the evidence from family, people who knew Jesse, and records, which we will investigate in this book, are as follows: <BR><BR>In 1874 he paid &ldquo;Eight-hundred (gold) dollars&rdquo; for a 160 acre tract of land that he purchased from Thomas Hudson Barron. <BR><BR>Our grandfather, his siblings, and my great-great-grandfather&rsquo;s old neighbors said he was extremely cautious. When someone would ride up to his house after dark, he would blow out all the coal-oil lanterns and lie down across the doorway with his pistols cocked. He was never further than arm&rsquo;s reach from a gun. <BR><BR>He had gold and silver buried in different locations and drew maps with symbols and coded messages documenting their location. <BR><BR>The late George Roming of El Paso, Texas, saw around twenty ingots of gold weighing fifteen to twenty pounds each stacked on a shelf in his barn. <BR>Our great-great-grandfather and a group of men buried 680 ingots of gold. <BR><BR>He had five-gallon buckets of silver dollars sitting around his house. <BR><BR>Money was stored in the outhouse. <BR><BR>He had more than $50,000 in &ldquo;greenbacks&rdquo; stored in one of his trunks. <BR><BR>He made his son Byron C. Courtney Sr. count them each and every day. <BR><BR>He had thirteen five-gallon lard cans full of gold coins. <BR><BR>He and his associates &ldquo;sailed through the Great Depression&rdquo; because they had plenty of money. <BR><BR>He purchased large farms for each of his eight children when they were married. <BR><BR>Later in his life he owned Ford automobiles, and when any minor thing would go wrong with one of them he got a new one.<BR><BR>His shooting prowess was legendary--he could shoot the head off of a chicken while riding his horse at a dead run. <BR><BR>Facial identification experts have determined that historically accepted photographs of Jesse James and his family match family photographs of our great-great-grandfather and his family. <BR><BR>Our great-great-grandfather&rsquo;s personal diaries also offer clues that he was not James L. Courtney the Union soldier: He named two of his horses &ldquo;John&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reb&rdquo;. &ldquo;Johnny Reb&rdquo; is a term used to describe a Confederate soldier. He named another horse &ldquo;Copperhead.&rdquo; Copperhead was a term used to identify members of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a pre&#8211;Civil War, pro-Southern secret society founded in Ohio in 1854 by George W. L. Bickley, a Virginian, who soon moved the KGC to the South. Members were known as Copperheads. Many claim the James Gang was the military arm of the KGC.<BR><BR>A small booklet describing the rituals of the secret order known as the Knights of Labor, also known as the Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor, was found in our great-great-grandfather&rsquo;s personal belongings.

      <Text><![CDATA[&ldquo;Public fascination with enigmatic and mythical figures from history is often skewed by bias or myth; sometimes the truth is unpleasant and the lies are far more comfortable. Within <I>The Mysterious Life and Faked Death of Jesse James</I>, Daniel and Teresa Duke, the great-great-grandchildren of the famed outlaw, finally put to rest many of the myths and misconceptions. The book is a testimony to the tireless research of their mother, Betty Dorsett Duke, to find out the truth about her ancestor, which was sadly cut short by her untimely death. Daniel and Teresa have continued her legacy, and it is one that she--and Jesse--would no doubt be proud of.&rdquo;]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[&ldquo;Drawing on more than 20 years of research, Daniel and Teresa Duke expound upon the family lore, Jesse&rsquo;s diaries, and legal documents to disprove the misconception that their great-great-grandfather died in 1882 and instead reveal that he lived for another 40 years in Texas under a different name, remaining unapologetic about his outlaw days. They give us the details of Jesse&rsquo;s &lsquo;lost years&rsquo; and what about Jesse remains elusive to modern science.&rdquo;]]></Text>

Our internal flora influences our immune system, brain function, hormonal balance, cravings, sleep, mood, inflammatory response, digestion, nutrient assimilation, and elimination. <BR><BR>In this holistic guide to cultivating a healthy microbiome and managing gut health naturally, Bridgette Shea explores digestive functioning from the perspectives of both Western science and traditional medicine. She examines Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine principles on digestion and constitution types. She reveals how, in addition to describing what we now call the microbiome, traditional Chinese medicine also has long recognized the importance of an abdominal organ that modern science has only recently &#173;acknowledged: the mesentery, the tissues that connect and support the internal organs. <BR><BR>Going beyond probiotics and prebiotics, the author presents practices from Ayurveda and Chinese medicine to reestablish balance in your internal microbiome, support the mesentery, improve digestion and elimination, and restore a clear mind and strong immune system. She explains how to read your symptoms, from brain fog and fatigue to congestion and stool quality, and offers herbal remedies, acupuncture and acupressure techniques, and dietary methods to improve your internal health, including a microbiome dietary reset. <BR><BR>Revealing the diverse role that our inner microbial colonies play in keeping us happy and healthy, this book shows that by changing your microbiome, you can greatly improve your physical, emotional, and mental health.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>From the Introduction</B> <BR><BR>The human gut microbiome is likely the hottest scientific health topic right now. Even those who don&rsquo;t know the word &ldquo;microbiome&rdquo; are aware of what&rsquo;s called the gut-brain connection, or the second brain in the gut, and the existence of probiotics. What most people may not know is the extent to which scientists are discovering the diverse roles that our inner microbial colonies play in keeping us healthy and happy. Or how Eastern teachings are chock full of detailed information explaining the importance of the gut, the role of digestion on the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health of the individual, and how to manage gut health naturally. <BR><BR>Indian doctors practicing Ayurveda have known for millennia that most disease starts in the gut. Like their Chinese medicine peers, they have elaborate formulas for regulating gut health, and highly evolved yet simple dietary guidelines that anyone can follow to reestablish healthy digestive functioning. Think the digestive system doesn&rsquo;t take precedence over other bodily systems? Then imagine how you&rsquo;d feel if you were looking forward to an event but couldn&rsquo;t leave the house because you had diarrhea, or if you wanted to go have fun on your beach vacation but suffered with constipation, gas, and bloating the whole time. Then recognize that this is a daily reality for too many people. Not only that, but since science has firmly established that some chronic, often debilitating diseases and cancers have in common certain bacterial communities in the gut, we have more serious, seemingly concrete reasons to pay attention. <BR><BR>The homeostasis our microbiome constantly works to maintain has not only been mentioned, but emphasized by traditional cultures and medicine systems for thousands of years. Maintaining a balance of humors, doshas, elements, fluids, metabolic processes, thermoregulation, systems of circulation, bodily tissues, life airs, biological rhythms, and yin and yang is the crux of traditional preventative medicine, treatment, and vital longevity. Ancient cultures had people who lived to 100 and beyond. They didn't have hand sanitizer and antibiotics, yet under normal and harsher circumstances than we experience in modern living, they still flourished. And we are here because of them. In such harsh circumstances without the comforts or conveniences of modern society, how did so many of them make it so long?<BR><BR>Perhaps the wisdom to live with optimal health has been within us all along and it's as unique to each of us as our fingerprint. That's right, your microbiome is as individual to you as your DNA, a snowflake in a storm, or your fingerprint. Just like there is only one you, there is only one mix of your individual microbiota. It is interesting to note that the aforementioned ancient medical systems also believed in the concept of individual constitution, not a one-size-fits-all scenario. These unique constitutional tendencies are recognized to require specific diet and lifestyle tweaks in order to stay balanced and therefore, healthy. It is my belief that these ancient prescriptions for ultimate vitality and maximized good health are the best tool we have in lieu of enough science to know what to do to take optimal care of ourselves and our microbiomes. They are vital, living, systems of medicine in practice all over the world today, including, most likely, your own community. <BR><BR>There is a lot of information in this book, and there is a lot of information that isn&rsquo;t in this book. I want to make clear that this is not a scientific paper, nor is it pseudoscience. It is a delicately balanced blend of what the average intelligent, free thinking, interested human being needs to know from a modern scientific and medical perspective as well as from the teachings of Eastern medicine, in order to understand the microbiome in a way that helps them heal. I haven&rsquo;t gone into the cacophony of microbes and where they are and what they do. That is something that our knowledge of is changing every day. What doesn&rsquo;t change are the guidelines Eastern medicine clearly lays out that we can follow to maintain optimal health. <BR><BR>My interest lies largely in managing the microbiome holistically, using the science and wisdom that goes back millennia as a guide, and then implementing it into daily living. If you are serious about truly taking charge of your health and are open to living more according to natural cycles and by common sense in many cases, then read on. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with feeling drowsy, bloated, unfocused, or unmotivated, if your cycles are disrupted, your sleep disturbed, your emotions unpredictable or stuck in one gear, read on. The information contained in this book is for you. It weaves together what we have always known with what we are confirming daily with the scientific method. Why wait another century until the principles of Chinese medicine or Ayurveda are scientifically proven? Read on to prove them in the lab of your own life and feel free and healthier now.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[&ldquo;Finally! A book demonstrating how the ancient traditional medical systems of both China and India understood the importance of the gut microbiome. The ancients, along with Hippocrates, declared that all diseases begin in the gut. As part of both the digestive and immune systems, numerous health problems result once these delicate flora are disturbed: autoimmune diseases, food allergies, and cancer, to name a few. Reestablishing intestinal health should be the starting point for the treatment of any disease. The research cited throughout this book corroborates over and over what these ancient doctors described in their texts thousands of years ago. A must-read for anyone interested in getting to the root cause of all diseases.&rdquo;]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<b><BR>from Chapter 1: The Modern World and Traditional Man</b> <BR><BR>This book sets out to study some of the ways in which the present age appears essentially as an age of dissolution. At the same time, it addresses the question of what kind of conduct and what form of existence are appropriate under the circumstances for a particular human type.<BR><BR>This restriction must be kept in mind. What I am about to say does not concern the ordinary man of our day. On the contrary, I have in mind the man who finds himself involved in today&rsquo;s world, even at its most problematic and paroxysmal points; yet he does not belong inwardly to such a world, nor will he give in to it. He feels himself, in essence, as belonging to a different race from that of the overwhelming majority of our contemporaries. The natural place for such a man, the land in which he would not be a stranger, is the world of Tradition. . . . <BR><BR>Everything that has come to predominate in the modern world is the exact antithesis of any traditional type of civilization. Moreover, the circumstances make it increasingly unlikely that anyone, starting from the values of Tradition (even assuming that one could still identify and adopt them), could take actions or reactions of a certain efficacy that would provoke any real change in the current state of affairs. After the last worldwide upheavals, there seems to be no starting point either for nations or for the vast majority of individuals--nothing in the institutions and general state of society, nor in the predominant ideas, interests, and energies of this epoch.<BR><BR>Nevertheless, a few men exist who are, so to speak, still on their feet among the ruins and the dissolution, and who belong, more or less consciously, to that other world. A little group seems willing to fight on, even in lost positions. . . But this does not resolve the practical, personal problem--apart from the case of the man who is blessed with the opportunity for material isolation--of those who cannot or will not burn their bridges with current life, and who must therefore decide how to conduct their existence, even on the level of the most elementary reactions and human relations.<BR><BR>This is precisely the type of man that the present book has in mind. To him applies the saying of a great precursor: &ldquo;The desert encroaches. Woe to him whose desert is within!&rdquo; He can in truth find no further support from without. There no longer exist the organizations and institutions that, in a traditional civilization and society, would have allowed him to realize himself wholly, to order his own existence in a clear and unambiguous way, and to defend and apply creatively in his own environment the principal values that he recognizes within himself. . . <BR><BR>There is an important point to clarify at the outset regarding the attitude to be taken toward &ldquo;survivals.&rdquo; Even now, especially in Western Europe, there are habits, institutions, and customs from the world of yesterday (that is, from the bourgeois world) that have a certain persistence. . . . This is not what I call the world of Tradition. Socially, politically, and culturally, what is crashing down is the system that took shape after the revolution of the Third Estate and the first industrial revolution, even though there were often mixed up in it some remnants of a more ancient order, drained of their original vitality.<BR><BR>What kind of relationship can the human type whom I intend to treat here have with such a world?<BR><BR>The answer to this question can only be negative. The human type I have in mind has nothing to do with the bourgeois world. He must consider everything bourgeois as being recent and antitraditional, born from processes that in themselves are negative and subversive.<BR><BR>. . .It is good to sever every link with all that which is destined sooner or later to collapse. The problem will then be to maintain one&rsquo;s essential direction without leaning on any given or transmitted form, including forms that are authentically traditional but belong to past history. . . . As we shall soon see, the support that Tradition can continue to give does not refer to positive structures, regular and recognized by some civilization already formed by it, but rather to that doctrine that contains its principles only in their superior, preformal state, anterior to the particular historical formulations: a state that in the past had no pertinence to the masses, but had the character of an esoteric doctrine. <b><BR><BR>from Chapter 2: The End of a Cycle<BR><BR></b>. . .The phrase chosen as title of this book, &ldquo;Ride the Tiger,&rdquo; may serve as a transition between what has been said hitherto, and this other order of ideas. The phrase is a Far Eastern saying, expressing the idea that if one succeeds in riding a tiger, not only does one avoid having it leap on one, but if one can keep one&rsquo;s seat and not fall off, one may eventually get the better of it. . . <BR><BR>This symbolism is applicable at various levels. First, it can refer to a line of conduct in the interior, personal life; then to the appropriate attitude in the face of critical, historical, and collective situations. . . . In the classical world, it was presented in terms of humanity&rsquo;s progressive descent from the Golden Age to what Hesiod called the Iron Age. In the corresponding Hindu teaching, the final age is called the Kali Yuga (Dark Age). Its essential quality is emphatically said to be a climate of dissolution, in which all the forces--individual and collective, material, psychic, and spiritual--that were previously held in check by a higher law and by influences of a superior order pass into a state of freedom and chaos.]]></Text>

Taking readers step-by-step through the nine energetic levels of dying, author Suzanne Worthley explains what is happening at each level or dimension energetically, what to watch for in each stage, and specific ways in which we can support our loved ones through their transition back to spirit. For each of the nine stages, she describes what the dying person may see and experience, including the stages of transition at which people undergo the familiar elements of near-death experiences, such as entering a tunnel, conducting a life review, or encountering angels, guides, loved ones in spirit, or a bright light. She explores what family members and friends may see and experience, such as spirit energy, and what they can do to offer practical support and emotional solace to their loved one. <BR><BR>Examining how life force energy works as well as what Akashic records and soul contracts are, Worthley shares hospice case studies for each level of transition, so caregivers can see how belief systems and energy blocks in specific chakras affect the death process and why it is important to clear energy blocks like fear, anger, or guilt during life if possible. She explores the grieving process and offers helpful strategies for moving through it as well as &ldquo;at-a-glance&rdquo; reference tables of the nine stages and related healing strategies designed to be referred to by those holding vigil. <BR><BR>Shedding light on one of the great mysteries of existence, <I>An Energy Healer&rsquo;s Book of Dying</I> offers a compact yet comforting guide to support you through this emotional, grief-filled, and exhausting time and help you bring solace to your loved one during the transition back to spirit.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>Introduction </B><BR><BR>I grew up as the daughter of a mortician. As a child, I never thought of my father&rsquo;s job as different or odd. Actually, I never really thought about it at all. My mother stayed home to raise my five siblings and me, while my father spent his days working in the funeral home. For some, a funeral home can be an uncomfortable place, but for me, it was a second home. I spent every Saturday there after piano lessons. It was my father&rsquo;s office. It was where we hung out. It was a normal part of life--just like riding in the hearse. For some, a hearse represents dread and sorrow, but for me it was our family car, which could easily tote around six children. <BR><BR>Later on, I learned my upbringing wasn&rsquo;t all that conventional. Most kids didn&rsquo;t talk about death and dying at the dinner table alongside the usual topics of school, grades, and boyfriends. It wasn&rsquo;t until high school when I noticed a difference in the way my friends thought about death. I admit I could cause quite a stir in a group of teenagers when they found out I was a mortician&rsquo;s daughter. Even today, I still find most folks are uncomfortable with the subject of dying. I personally never thought of death as something scary, icky, or weird. I certainly didn&rsquo;t perceive my father working with death as something scary, icky, or weird. I believed then (and now) that death is simply part of our life path. It is not to be feared as much as embraced. Even as a child, I intuitively knew that any professional who assisted the loved ones left behind during their loved one&rsquo;s journey of &ldquo;going home&rdquo; must be a person with a <I>gift</I>. My father has that gift, and he chose to share it with others. As an energy practitioner, spiritual healer, and hospice volunteer, I have had the opportunity to use this gift and spend numerous hours with people during what I feel is one of the most profound energetic and spiritual experiences ever--<I>their death</I>. I have witnessed firsthand, through the use of my psychic abilities and knowledge of our human energy systems, their incredible journey back to spirit. My hospice patients are so loving and giving of themselves. They are my teachers. Their homes and hospital rooms are my classrooms. I'm blessed they allow me to share such a personal, spiritual time and space, and I feel it is time to finally share what I have learned to help people through their own personal journey, whether they are the patient, the family member, the loved one, the friend, or the medical staff. <BR><BR>Doing this work has allowed me to find a unique perspective on how the soul processes and works in energy. I want to share firsthand what I see and offer you a new way to look at death <I>using psychic sight</I>. When we look at death only with our human eyes, we are often consumed by fear and sadness. But when we understand how to use <I>psychic sight</I>, we can move through the process in love and spirit. There are many who do not necessarily view the process of death as a gift, and I understand it can be a hard concept to understand. That is why I wrote this tiny book: to replace fear with knowledge. To encourage willing participation. To give power back to those who own it. To affirm miracles. To help people see through the perspective of the heart rather than the limited perspective of the ego. <BR><BR>This book is divided into two sections. In the first, I give some helpful background information: a description of how life force energy works, what the Akashic records and soul contracts are, and an overview of the energetic stages of the death process. In the second section, we&rsquo;ll go step-by-step through the nine energetic levels of dying, so you can understand what is happening at each level, know what to watch for in each stage, and learn specific ways in which you can support your loved one through their transition back to spirit. Additionally, I have included actual hospice visits as case studies so that you can see how others have experienced the stages of death in various ways. These case studies examine, on an energetic level, the experiences some hospice patients have had while shutting down specific chakras. I share these to assist you in seeing how energy blocks can affect the death process. Again, my goal is to help you to understand and clear the fears in life because they will indeed affect the death process. <BR><BR>You do not have to be psychic to have experiences similar to those you will read on the pages ahead. Anyone who has assisted a loved one, friend, or patient through the death process has most likely come into contact with some, or all, of the phases involved. Without the knowledge of what they are experiencing, the events are often dismissed or downplayed. Many find themselves doubting what they actually saw or felt as they walked with a loved one through the death process. The feelings in the room. The sensation of spiritual visitors. The shifting movement of light. The <I>coincidences</I> of how things and timing played out. By learning the phases of the journey to spirit, we can embrace the stages in a new light--one of divine energy. <BR><BR>Just like my father used his gift to help families after the death process, my purpose is to offer perspectives to help the dying person and his or her family members and friends move through the death process with love. I do not in any way mean to impose my vision on others. Death is personal, private, and probably one of the more sacred occurrences we encounter, either for our self or our loved ones. I only offer my perspective as a gift of sharing.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA["In this book, Suzanne Worthley helps us to understand not just from a physical perspective but from a spiritual/energetic perspective just what an amazing journey the dying go through as the soul leaves form and travels home. Suzanne writes with the passion of one who has first-hand experience of having watched with the dying. I hear the truth in her words regarding unfinished business, 'As a soul, we will still need to do the work whether we are on this side of the veil or not.' This encourages us to integrate our shadows here and now whilst still embodied. She further comforts us with the words, 'We are all born from love. We are all made from love. We have the ability to return to love.' Thank you, Suzanne, you have served us well in sharing your wisdom of death and dying.&rdquo;]]></Text>

As a result, they are afflicted with health problems ranging from minor skin irritations, chronic fatigue, back pain, and depression to arthritis, ulcers, and osteoporosis. To enjoy optimum health, the body needs balanced quantities of alkaline and acid substances. In <I>The Acid-Alkaline Diet for Optimum Health</I>, naturopath and detoxification expert Christopher Vasey shows how a simple change in diet to restore your acid-alkaline balance can result in vast improvements in health. <BR> <BR>With two new chapters, this updated and expanded second edition provides the latest information on proper hydration and deacidification, important alkalizing supplements, and how to eliminate the body&rsquo;s accumulated acids through intestinal cleansing. It also includes a new, detailed example of an alkaline detoxifying diet. Rather than organizing alkaline and acid foods based on their chemical composition, Vasey categorizes foods by their effect on the body, explaining that some foods, such as fruits, can have either an alkalizing or an acidifying effect, depending on who eats them. He describes how to determine your acid levels and how to design a diet best suited for your particular health needs.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>from Chapter 8 <BR><BR>Other Important Supplements</B><BR><BR>In addition to the alkaline minerals mentioned in the previous chapter, there are other supplements that are quite useful for deacidifying the body: green food, enzyme supplements, prebiotic and probiotic complexes, and antioxidant complexes. All four reduce the production of acids by the body.<BR><BR><B>ENZYME SUPPLEMENTS</B><BR><BR>People suffering from an acidified internal cellular environment are generally not eating enough vegetables, the principal food source for alkaline minerals. The result is a deficiency not only of alkaline substances, but also of enzymes. Enzymes play an important role for maintaining the acid-alkaline balance.<BR><BR>Enzymes are protein-based molecules that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions, triggering and supervising the reactions. Enzymes perform numerous transformations in the body without which it could not survive.<BR><BR>Every enzyme has a specific function that no other enzyme can perform. Enzymes are necessary for the digestion of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates and for their assimilation and incorporation into the tissues; for the production of energy; for cellular repair; for the breakdown and elimination of toxins; for the body&rsquo;s defense system; and so forth. There are thousands of enzymes in the body, acting in synergy. As each is responsible for only a specific part of the work, different enzymes work together, each stepping in at a specific moment and at a precise place in the long chain of biochemical transformations.<BR><BR>Enzymes are distributed throughout the cells and tissues, each type of enzyme located at the exact spot the body needs it. The body is constantly producing new enzymes to replace those that have been used. This production is not a quick-and-easy process, though. It is sufficient to compensate for the normal loss of enzymes, but not when abnormal demands are made on the body at this level. Such demands are made in the digestion of cooked food.<BR><BR>Foods also contain enzymes, but they are very sensitive to heat. Too high a temperature during the cooking process destroys them. Cooked foods, whether boiled, steamed, or baked in an oven or microwave, are more or less impoverished of enzymes, depending on the mode of cooking used. Only the enzymes that survive the heat can take part in the digestion of the food from which they came. The body consequently has to supply the enzymes that were destroyed when the food was cooked, which gradually reduces its own reserves, especially if meals consist primarily or exclusively of cooked foods, if the individual overeats, or if the foods are refined (refined foods have already been stripped of a portion of their enzymes).<BR><BR>With these eating habits, which are followed by the majority of people today, over the long term the body&rsquo;s enzymatic capability shrinks. This means that biochemical transformations are not being performed as well, and that much more acid waste is produced during the metabolic process than normal. So just how does this occur? For example, let&rsquo;s take the transformation of glucose--that is, sugar--into energy. Because of the activity of various enzymes, glucose is first transformed into citric acid, then pyruvic acid, succinic acid, and fumaric acid in succession, ending finally as lactic acid. This acid is then attacked by another enzyme that transforms it into energy.<BR><BR>Normally, these transformations are carried out to the final stage, and the acids do not survive as acids because they have been converted into energy. But if there is an enzyme deficiency, the glucose transformation comes to a halt during the acid stages, and the result is acidification of the body&rsquo;s internal cellular environment, which would not occur if enough enzymes were available.<BR><BR>Transition through a series of acid stages also takes place when the body converts fats and proteins for its use. This process is so extensive that the inevitable consequence of any enzyme deficiency is acidification of the body. Of course, the more extensive the enzyme deficiency, the more acidic the body becomes, eventually resulting in illness. This process is exacerbated by the fact that an acid organic environment inhibits enzyme activity, which reduces the enzymes&rsquo; effectiveness and increases the production of acid wastes even more.<BR><BR>To escape this vicious cycle, it is crucial to give the body the enzymes it needs. One way of doing this is to sharply increase consumption of raw vegetables at the two major meals of the day, noon and evening. Raw foods can be eaten either in the form of salad greens or as a side dish of colored vegetables like carrots or beets, or even as a mixed salad incorporating both. Thoroughly chewing these raw foods increases the benefit of this intake, because this frees more enzymes from the cellulose framework that binds them.<BR><BR>The benefits offered by a larger intake of enzymes can be easily seen: a cooked meal is digested more easily when raw foods have been added to it. We feel lighter after a meal accompanied by salad or raw vegetables because the digestion of the enzyme-poor cooked foods has been facilitated by the extra enzymes contributed by the raw foods.<BR><BR>Another way for the body to obtain the enzymes it needs is via enzymatic supplements. This additional support is often essential, because eating more raw foods is sufficient to address only minor enzyme deficiencies and maintain the proper acid&#8211;alkaline balance; if an individual&rsquo;s enzymatic capacity has been overdrawn, deacidification requires a contribution of enzymes from supplements in addition to those supplied by the food in the diet.<BR><BR>The enzymes in commercial supplements are prepared so that they retain their properties even after they have entered the digestive tract, resisting stomach acids and other substances that could destroy them on their way to the cells. Taken on a daily basis in combination with a diet high in raw vegetables, the enzymes supplied by supplements should cause a sharp reduction in the body&rsquo;s level of acidification. They help the body burn acids away, contributing to a quicker restoration of the body&rsquo;s pH.]]></Text>

Breaking a habit can be &#173;daunting--it&rsquo;s hard to know where to begin beyond quitting &ldquo;cold turkey.&rdquo; But just as habits can be acquired, they can be broken. Others have done it, and so can you! <BR><BR>In this holistic guide to beating addiction, Brigitte Mars details how to replace negative habits and behaviors with positive healthy ones and safely support your body, mind, and spirit for a successful recovery. The author shares specific herbs, supplements, homeopathic remedies, flower essences, behavioral therapy, and alternative practices, such as meditation and yoga, that can help liberate you from habitual substance use and ease the withdrawal period as well as methods for cleansing the body of toxins and healthy ways to combat depression, anxiety, fatigue, and stress. She looks in depth at individual addictive substances and behaviors, including sugar, caffeine, alcohol, opioids, tobacco, and tranquilizers, offering specific advice and remedies for each. She shows how each technique can be used in conjunction with conventional therapies, such as psychotherapy, methadone, or Alcoholics Anonymous. Drawing on recent research, she also explores the enormous potential of psychedelic therapy for overcoming addiction and, with the spreading legalization of cannabis, she addresses how this plant can be of benefit for recovery, without being misused. <BR><BR>Offering advice on designing a personal program to break your addictions, the author also shows how to use natural remedies to maintain your new energy and vitality as you walk the road to recovery.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>From Chapter 9. Jitterbug Blues: Making It through the Withdrawal Period</B><BR><BR>If you&rsquo;ve made the decision to kick your addiction, congratulations! A happier, healthier world is awaiting you. First, though, you have to get through the withdrawal period. Many people have multiple addictions, and you may find it easier to tackle the most serious of them first--alcohol before tobacco and tobacco before chocolate, for example--but following the program for one addiction may well put you on the road to recovery for others as well. If you are eating a healthier diet and supporting your body with herbs and supplements, you may find that by the time you have dealt with the more serious addictions, the others have almost resolved themselves. <BR><BR>For some people, withdrawal symptoms don&rsquo;t amount to much, while for others they pose a serious challenge. And withdrawal is more than simply enduring cravings for a particular substance; you may feel jittery, irritable, or depressed, and you may have physical symptoms ranging from headaches to tremors. <BR><BR>It can take a year or more before you feel completely healed physically and stable emotionally. But it&rsquo;s well worth it! The road to recovery brings you revitalized energy,health, and happiness. You&rsquo;ll feel better, look better, and live better. All you have to do is make the decision--and stick with it! <BR><BR><B>Detoxification</B> <BR><BR>Addictive substances disrupt the body&rsquo;s normal processes and the mind&rsquo;s normal thought patterns. To kick an addiction, you must detoxify both body and mind, first by cleansing, and then by rebuilding.<BR><BR>&bull; Cleansing means avoiding the substance of your addiction, drinking teas and eating foods that help cleanse the body of toxic wastes and drug residue, and giving up the psychological dependency. <BR><BR>&bull; Rebuilding involves supporting and nurturing those bodily organs and systems that have been weakened or damaged by the addiction, learning new, healthier habits that can replace the unhealthy behavior of addiction, and building networks of emotional support to help you through the withdrawal period.<BR><BR>Physiological effects from substance abuse are almost always reversible. But when you make the decision to free yourself from an addiction, your body does not return to its natural state overnight. Have patience.<BR><BR><I><B>Be Open with Family and Friends </B></I><BR><BR>Beating an addiction is hard work, and you&rsquo;re most likely to be successful if you have the help of those who love you. <BR><BR><B><I>Nutritional Therapy</I></B> <BR><BR>It&rsquo;s imperative to keep your blood sugar levels stable during the detoxification process. Unstable blood sugar levels drain you of energy and can contribute to cravings. To stabilize blood sugar levels, eat four or five small meals a day. Have a healthy snack before bed and then eat again early in the morning. <BR><BR>Green leafy vegetables provide ample amounts of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Their high nutrient content nourishes the body and promotes regeneration of damaged systems, their chlorophyll helps the body better utilize oxygen, and their fiber content aids in the elimination of toxins. <BR><BR>High-sulfur vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower also aid in detoxification. They are full of antioxidants, which help protect the body against free radicals. <BR><BR>To add more calming calcium to your diet, eat yogurt or drink goat&rsquo;s milk. <BR>Protein is also important during withdrawal, because it can reduce cravings. Good protein sources include legumes, tofu, tempeh, poultry, nuts, seeds, and eggs. Fish is an excellent source of protein and is rich in the raw material the body needs to make its needed neurotransmitters. Do not eat sugar--as a superrefined carbohydrate without much nutritional value, it will keep your body in an addictive mode, as I discussed in chapter 3. Reduce your intake of refined foods. Choose organic foods whenever possible. <BR><BR>Those who experience digestive distress during the withdrawal process may fare well with easy-to-digest foods such as high-protein baby food, blended soups, and pureed vegetables. <BR><BR>To minimize shaking and tremors during withdrawal, eat adequate protein and plenty of whole grains such as oatmeal, millet, and brown rice. Be sure to drink plenty of pure water so that wastes may be more effectively carried away. Have a drink of water whenever a craving arises. The addition of a bit of lemon juice to the water you consume can be even more effective: its sour flavor stimulates liver cleansing. Diluted unsweetened cranberry juice is also cleansing to the liver and kidneys. If you experience diarrhea or vomiting, be sure to drink electrolyterich beverages to help rehydrate and replace lost trace minerals. <BR><BR><I><B>Skin Brushing</B></I><BR><BR>Skin is often referred to as the third lung, and dry-brushing the skin can aid in the detoxification of the body by boosting circulation and improving lymphatic flow. As a side benefit, after regular practice you&rsquo;ll end up with soft, glowing, healthy skin. <BR><BR>Skin brushing should be done with a soft vegetable-fiber brush just before you bathe. Disrobe and, starting with your feet, gently brush the skin in a circular motion.Work your way up the legs, then the hands and arms, and finally the torso, both front and back. The entire procedure should take two to three minutes. Be especially gentle over the breasts and avoid the genitals. Then shower or bathe. End with cool water to give yourself a forced circulatory massage. <BR><BR><I><B>Hydrotherapy <BR></B></I><BR>Soaking in a tepid bath to which three pounds of Epsom salts have been added is not only relaxing but also helps detoxify your system and draw out old drug and chemical residues. Neutral-temperature baths (between 92 and 98 degrees) soothe the nervous system and promote detoxification. <BR><BR>Sauna baths, sweat lodges, and steam baths also speed the release of toxic substances through sweating. They can have profoundly healing and spiritually opening effects if you enter them with the intention of releasing and purifying. They should, however, be enjoyed with a buddy, because the intense heat can lead to lightheadedness and dizziness.<BR><BR>After a detox bath or sweat therapy, rinse off, get covered up, and enjoy some bedrest. Those with high blood pressure should consult their doctor before using any bath or sweat therapies.]]></Text>

Hughes shares ancient secret Druidic techniques of divination passed down to him across five generations in an unbroken lineage of influential Welsh Druids. <BR><BR>Hughes explains the three forms of divination used by his tradition: interpretive divination, used by readers of the Sevens (small staves with engraved sigils); inductive divination, which includes instructions for reading the wind, reading smoke, and divination using water; and intuitive divination, whose tools includes cup-stones and slate mirrors for scrying. Providing step-by-step instructions for practices in each of the three forms, he offers a wealth of divinatory techniques and explains how to access the altered states of consciousness necessary to read time backward and forward. He also explores the crafting and use of all tools and mixtures the reader will need to perform each type of divination, including botanical compounds, scrying wands, and a slate speculum vitae, the &ldquo;mirror of life.&rdquo; He reveals how the prime function of divination in this school of Druidic lore is to gain insight into past, present, and future events through a process of internalizing them, akin to empathy, and then interpreting them. <BR><BR>By providing an understanding of pre-Celtic beliefs and clear instructions for Druidic practices, Hughes offers each of us the opportunity to begin our own practical experimentation and journey of discovery into the ancient art of Druidic divination.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>From Chapter 7. Intuitive Divination by Cup-stone Scrying--The Bullaun <BR><BR></B>Although this is a further form of intuitive divination, I have chosen to include it in order to place all the techniques described above in the historical and cultural context of our overall exploration of Druidic divination. <BR><BR>Here we shall explore the oldest, but now least-used form of Druidic divination: cup-stone scrying. <BR><BR>The focal point or portal for this ancient technique is the cup-stone, which is an ancient ritual artifact found not only in Wales and Ireland, but also in England, Scotland, much of Northern Europe, and as far afield as Scandinavia. <BR><BR>The oldest examples are identified as originating sometime during the Neolithic age, which dates them somewhere in the region of 10,200 BCE, over twelve thousand years ago.However, the majority of examples have been dated to sometime around 4,000 BCE, making them at least 6,000 years old. <BR><BR>As the name suggests, cup-stones, in this context, are medium-sized, smooth stones with a cup-shape hollowed out at the top. There are some instances where such stone hollows have been formed naturally, either by the motion of the sea or by river eddies, but the cup-stones we are considering are most definitely man-made for a specific use. <BR><BR>Known in the Irish tradition as &ldquo;Bullaun&rdquo; stones and in the Welsh tradition as &ldquo;Cerrig Cwpan,&rdquo; their significance (if not their precise use) extends from Neolithic times. <BR><BR>In general appearance, these stones may be thought to have been used as querns, for grinding grain, herbs, or similar food preparation, but the locations at which most of these Bullauns have been discovered, such as high rocky outcrops and other ritual sites, makes their use for domestic tasks such as food preparation look unlikely. More significantly, the oral tradition of Druidic lore and long-standing local folklore of the region attaches spiritual or magical significance to the Bullaun. One such belief in the Irish tradition, that persists to the present day, is that the rainwater collecting in a stone&rsquo;s hollow has healing and curative properties, and history tells us that the ritual use of some Bullaun stones continued well into the Christian period and many are found in association with early Christian churches. It is also worth noting that a number of Recumbent Stones laying within Stone Circles in Ireland, Wales, and England have cup-hollows carved into their surface. These Recumbent Stones were/are the focal point of the many Workings and rituals that take place within the Circles, further illustrating the use of cup-stones and cup-hollows as essential ritual artefacts. <BR><BR>As the Christian Saints entered the territories of the pre-Celtic tribes and encountered the Bullaun being used in Pagan ritual, they &ldquo;demonized&rdquo; the stones and condemned their use. They quickly renamed them &ldquo;cursing stones&rdquo; or &ldquo;tormenting stones&rdquo; and drew them into the confines of the newly-built churches so that they could be closely supervised. Finding that their Christian converts still held on to many of their pagan beliefs and traditions the Christian fathers worked to adapt and assimilate the &ldquo;Old Ways&rdquo; into their Christian practices. One of the many, many &ldquo;rebranding&rdquo; projects they undertook in their efforts toward religious syncretism was to invent a new history for the Bullaun, which now became &ldquo;praying stones&rdquo; and &ldquo;blessing stones,&rdquo; originating from a tale of an Irish Saint, who, when dropped on his head as a child upon such a stone, became instantly Saintly and at the same time his now saintly head created a hollow in the stone which henceforth was destined to collect and retain healing rainwater with miraculous curative qualities. <BR><BR>We can observe this absorption of the Bullaun cup-stone into the early Celtic-Christian church with a prime example at Muckross Abbey, Killarney, Count Kerry. Topping the wall surrounding the cloister at the Abbey is a smooth 12 inch-wide capping stone balustrade. At one side of the cloister&rsquo;s rectangle we can see a cup, Bullaun, carved into the stone alongside a compass defining the Cardinal Points. <BR><BR>It may seem difficult to imagine that Pagan Druidic ceremonies (Workings) were actually being carried out regularly within the Abbey&rsquo;s Cloister, but this layout is identical to that of a Druidic Working Stone, usually within a Stone Circle, and there are no known recorded Christian ceremonies that utilize these particular features. <BR><BR>The Bullaun had found a new history and a welcome new home in the confines of the increasing numbers of Christian Churches covering the landscape of Ireland and Wales. We will encounter such a stone &ldquo;convert&rdquo; later as we familiarize ourselves with the Neolithic Bullaun at the ruins of Aghadoe Cathedral, the first Cathedral in Ireland, less than a mile from my home in County Kerry. <BR><BR>Many Bullaun were, and still are, used in conjunction with &ldquo;cur(s)e&rdquo; stones, small rounded stones placed inside the hollow of the Bullaun. These would be used by turning them while invoking an Intention (A Druidic Prayer) or, more often, while focusing the senses on a Divination Working. It would also be common to add essential oils, other oils, or even butter, to the hollow to create an unctuous, sensuous quality as the stones are turned within the Bullaun, relaxing the Diviner and strengthening their bond with the stones during the Working.<BR><BR>In Cornwall, UK, another area of Druidic influence, Bullaun have been discovered that are unmistakably womb shaped and have a distinct channel carved in the position of the birth canal. The Tradition tells of the use of these &ldquo;womb stone&rdquo; Bullaun in fertility rituals and birthing rites in Wales and Ireland as well as on the Cornish peninsula in the UK. But we will return our attention to the simple Bullaun and its cur(s)e stones as used in the Irish and Welsh tradition, and in particular to the ancient Bullaun mentioned earlier located at Aghadoe Cathedral.]]></Text>

He examines how commonly shared principles of creational science are reflected in key terms of the ancient languages. He discusses how the primal cosmology also transmitted key components of sacred science, such as sacred geometry, knowledge of material creation, and the nature of a nonmaterial universe--evidence for which lies in the orientation of ancient temples, the drama of initiations and rituals, and countless traditional myths. He analyzes how this shared knowledge relates to the precessional year and the cycles of time known as the yugas. He also explores evidence of the concept of a nonmaterial twin universe to our own--the &ldquo;above&rdquo; to our &ldquo;below&rdquo; in the famous alchemical and hermetic maxim. <BR><BR>Through his extensive research into the interconnected wisdom of the ancients, Scranton shows that the forgotten instructional tradition at the source of this knowledge was deliberately encoded to survive for countless generations. By piecing it back together, we can discover the ancient plan for guiding humanity forward toward greater enlightenment.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>Chapter Four. Metaphors of the Cosmology <BR><BR></B>We have said that the scientific images and concepts that populate the ancient cosmology imply that its meanings were aimed at a future audience, one that would have necessarily gained the technological capability to recognize and confirm its references. The many intervening generations, for whom technology might not be sufficiently advanced to allow for that, were charged with the caretaking, preservation and transmission of those references (not a simple task, to anyone who ever played the children&rsquo;s game of telephone). One challenge for the authors of the symbolic cosmology would have been to couch those references in such a way as to have the best chance of being correctly understood hundreds or thousands of years later. A technique that lent itself to this requirement was that of a metaphor, by which we frame a concept we know a person might not understand in relation to one that is more familiar to them. The Dogon understand that the act of teaching a person is not always a simple task because it can meet with resistance. In the Dogon view efforts to convey knowledge often require us to &ldquo;tug against a thing that pulls back&rdquo;--in their mind, like pulling on wild grass. It is in this sense that the Dogon people self-deprecatingly refer to themselves as &ldquo;wild grass, acknowledging that it may simply be human nature to resist instructed knowledge.&rdquo; Even for a modern person the essential experience of arriving at some new bit of cosmological knowledge is often a kind of bemusement over how very dense we were about grasping some seemingly obscure concept that now seems perfectly evident to us. <BR><BR>Precisely because of this seemingly natural human resistance to learning, one of the likely imperatives for those who framed the ancient symbolic system was to find ways to effectively navigate around it. One approach to that would be to prefer the most direct path to an intuitive understanding of any given concept, and thereby bypass the kind of extended lectures that many of us learned to tune out during our own educational experiences. Of course, as any lecturer who has made a PowerPoint presentation knows, illustrating a concept with a related image is one effective way to do that. Using a short storyline to frame a point is another. Meanwhile, insightful comparisons made through a well-selected simile or metaphor can offer a third way to intuitively convey an idea to a person. <BR><BR>Metaphors are shortcuts to new understanding in that they exploit the benefit of things we already know. For that reason, a metaphor is most effective when it resonates with the experience of the person for whom it is devised. A well-chosen metaphor has the potential to convey a complex idea in a direct and insightful way, simply by positing that one thing can be understood to be intimately like another. With the best metaphors, understanding can be immediate and intuitive. However, if the comparison at the basis for the metaphor ultimately falls outside of the experience of the person for whom it is intended, then the knowledge to be conveyed will also ultimately miss its mark. So skill at formulating and expressing ideas through a careful choice of metaphors becomes one of the hallmarks of an excellent teacher. <BR><BR>In the case of ancient mythical teachers who knew they might well be distanced from their intended audience by thousands of years, selecting the proper metaphors may have seemed problematic, since there could be no certainty as to which ones would be likeliest to resonate with some imagined future recipient. To allow for this, metaphors of the symbolic tradition were commonly rooted in elements of the natural environment that are not prone to change quickly and therefore should likely continue to be experienced by people in the much the same way over a very long span of time. And so the natural effect of wind, which constitutes a universal effect, became a surrogate for the concept of vibration, while water references, which are also universal, convey the notion of ripples and of waves. Raindrops from a cloud familiarly illustrate the idea of multiplicity from unity. As is more directly demonstrated by the previously-mentioned Buddhist concept of the <I>adequate symbol</I>, elements that inhere in nature can be counted on to remain constant in the human experience and so provide an excellent basis for cross-generational metaphors. Additionally, many of the meanings of the cosmology are expressed redundantly in relation to more than just a single metaphor, both as a way to confirm an intentional meaning and perhaps in the hope that at least one of the chosen metaphors might resonate better than another with an uncertain future audience. <BR><BR>The concept of a metaphor, itself, is also leveraged within the symbolic cosmology, perhaps in keeping with the broad range of symbols that the system comes to encompass. The system defines a range of four-stage metaphors, modeled after the same pattern as the familiar primordial elements: water, fire, wind, and earth. These staged metaphors are intuitive in that many of them reflect progressions that can be readily observed in nature, such as the growth of a plant from a seed or the evolution of a mature bird from an egg. That approach to symbolic expression accustoms an initiate both to the technique of conceptualizing a complex process in stages and to resolving complex issues by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. If we take these four-stage metaphors as effective categories for the multiplicity of symbols themselves, then the metaphors make it possible for us to place a related set of progressive symbols into proper sequence with one another. For example, the sequence of water, fire, wind, and earth allows us to infer that any cosmological reference to &ldquo;waves&rdquo; must correspond to a process that falls at the early formative end of the scale of material creation, while those to &ldquo;earth&rdquo; properly belong at the culminating end.]]></Text>

When you are wounded, innate animalistic instincts for self-protection kick in as a means for survival. These behavior patterns are a natural and necessary coping strategy, at first. But many dwell far too long in these patterns and separate themselves from their source of inner wisdom and intuition. <BR><BR>Using astrology as a diagnostic tool, Lisa Tahir reveals how to use the astrological placement of the minor planet Chiron in your birth chart to identify the core wounds and unconscious patterns that block your capacity to have self-empathy and to forgive. Coining the phrase &ldquo;Chiron Effect&rdquo; to describe the magnetic pull that individuals have around specific areas of vulnerability, she explains how, like a raw nerve, the placement of Chiron describes what parts of our lives we might edit or hide for fear of being rejected as well as the areas of sensitivity where we are triggered. Offering a chart and online links to allow you to determine Chiron&rsquo;s placement in your chart, the author explains how Chiron affects you psychologically, emotionally, sexually, spiritually, socially, financially, and intellectually depending on the sign and house it falls within. She outlines how to begin healing your core wounds through empathy and self-forgiveness, providing several steps for each sign placement to shift self-destructive patterns and learn to protect yourself as well as powerful affirmations infused with Reiki healing energy to help you anchor a new belief system. <BR><BR>As Lisa Tahir reveals, once identified, your personal Chiron placement can become the source of your greatest healing and empowerment. By recognizing your core wounding and learning to offer yourself empathy and forgiveness, you can finally break free from suffering, end self-sabotage, and allow your life to unfold in a new way.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<B>From Chapter 6: Chiron in Aries--Core Wounding in Value and Worth</B> <BR><BR>Chiron entered the sign of Aries on April 17, 2018 and will spend about 8 years here. Historically when Chiron occupied the sign of Aries, changes in laws were initiated regarding human rights, personal freedoms, and social change. Chiron in Aries is about taking actions to &ldquo;break free.&rdquo; It brought sexual revolution during the &ldquo;Roaring 20s&rdquo; and the 18th Amendment (prohibition) in 1919. Well, we all know that prohibition really meant no inhibition! It brought the groundbreaking Stonewall riots of 1969 in Manhattan and the first LGBT Pride Parade in NYC in 1970. The Watergate scandal broke, and our president resigned office. All this, and even more internationally, under the powerful influence of Chiron in Aries who encourages us to action, to speak our voice, stand for our rights, and be who we are! How does Chiron in Aries affect you as an individual? <BR><BR>As an individual with Chiron in Aries, your relentless search for a stable and strong identity drives your life experience. At the same time, the psychoastrology of Chiron in Aries also creates a concurrent and conflicting emotional experience, which makes you feel like you already have an identity, but you invariably judge it to be weak. As a result, you find yourself in situations time and time again where you minimize your own needs. In the worst-case scenarios, your needs have been neglected by others. This episodic neglect of yourself and your needs speaks to your self-diminishment and unresolved sense of value and worth. <BR><BR>Because you have become so attuned to others and their needs, sometimes it may be hard for you to even know what you want or need. It may seem that you have lost connection to yourself. It&rsquo;s as if your selfhood may have been eclipsed and you are invariably not seen, heard, or validated. <BR><BR>This experience is disempowering to your self-confidence. And your ability to attract what you truly desire is obstructed. Instead of directly expressing your own needs, and to protect yourself from the pain of being under-valued and treated dismissively, you employ coping mechanisms of compensation and adaptation. <BR><BR>You run the risk of burnout in your profession and being unhappy in your personal life. This occurs because of consistent people pleasing and putting other&rsquo;s needs first. Overextending yourself is an ingrained habit you employ to keep conflict low. Working to keep the peace in your family, group, or organization is a must.<BR><BR>You may suffer privately from feelings of isolation, while simultaneously hoping that one day you will suddenly be seen, loved, and valued for the generous-hearted person you are. <BR><BR>The way you approach love has been built around a false belief that you have to work hard to be loved. Let me invite you to consider something you did not learn in your childhood, but that you can now step into and fully embrace. Here it is: you <B>don&rsquo;t</B> have to work hard to be loved, you <B>are</B> loveable, you <B>are</B> worthy, and you are good enough, just as you are. <BR><BR>Your work is to let go of the self-deprecating and defeating beliefs that hurt you. While allowing others to manage conflicts on their own, you can learn to possess and then express your personal preferences directly in positive and meaningful ways. <BR><BR>The psychological overlay of a wounded sense of self, coupled with the undervaluing of self, leads to feelings of depression, isolation, and unworthiness, this resulting in a sense of confusion about what to do.<BR><BR>While experiencing these difficult emotions it is easy to turn to maladaptive coping behaviors like self-harming through substance abuse/dependence and/or holding onto relationships and associations that no longer feel good or serve your highest good. <BR><BR>Often self-criticism and judgment of ourselves keep us in an unhealthy relationship or situation. We don&rsquo;t want to give up and move on, so we may stay and self-medicate instead. Self-harming behaviors reinforce our sense of unimportance because we stand in condemnatory judgment of ourselves. We may act to present a public image of having it all together, yet we may suffer privately. Lessening the grip of self-judgment and increasing the presence of self-love in our lives creates the psychic and energetic space to cultivate our value and worth. By committing to the prioritization of our needs, we learn to value ourselves. Coupled with pulling back from overextending ourselves for others, we shift and begin to embody our true value and worth.<BR><BR>We must gently and lovingly hold ourselves accountable for not, in the past, showing up on our own behalf. We are not unworthy for having made mistakes. Our identity is not engraved with our mistakes. Every misstep is an opportunity to learn and grow, and then do something different next time.<BR><BR>Because the wounding to our core value and sense of worth occurred in childhood, our &ldquo;inner child&rdquo; needs to be given messages of empathy and tenderness. Our inner child is a younger ego construct within our adult ego state. She/he typically makes her/himself known when we feel hurt, vulnerable, anxious, avoidant, jealous, upset, ungrounded, angry, fearful, or self-doubting.<BR><BR>Our adult ego state often tells our vulnerable inner child self to &ldquo;go away, be quiet, or hide.&rdquo; If you repress these uncomfortable feelings of vulnerability to the point where the feelings become unconscious, they begin to drive your life in direction of self-sabotage, etc. <BR><BR>Transformation and healing of this wound comes through sending your inner child, adolescent, and adult ego states nurturing and love with messages of support and empathy. This begins a process of insourcing healthy self-esteem and positive feelings for yourself, instead of outsourcing that job to others, resulting in a roller coaster of emotions for you.<BR><BR>Daily guided meditations that focus upon forgiveness and love can accelerate the healing process. A plan of regular self-care can include setting aside the time and space to think and assess whether or not your commitments are truly serving you. . . .]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[&ldquo;As an astrologer I have always found Chiron to be both a key to understanding the wounds we repeat and the guide to living out our soul&rsquo;s purpose. There has never been, until now, a book that guides astrologers, healing practitioners, and readers alike to articulating that purpose. In The Chiron Effect, Tahir offers a brilliant synthesis of psychology and astrology, but most of all she offers hope for the healing of our souls.&rdquo;]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA["Chiron in astrology means "wounded healer" Author Tahir uses Chiron in "<I>The Chiron Effect Healing Our Wounds through Astrology, Empathy and Self- Forgiveness</I>" to help people with a number of negative aspects of their lives. She also utilizes principals of psychology and Eric Fromm as well as other modern-day techniques to achieve a perfect balanced life. So often books of this type have only concentrated on the Astrological aspect that appeal to a much slimer audience. By combing known aspects of treatments as well as telling personal stories "<I>The Chiron Effect</I>" is a valuable resource that appeals to a much larger group of people in need of help in this Covid time."]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<b>The #1 </b><i><b>New York Times </b></i><b>bestselling author of </b><i><b>Big Summer</b></i><b> masterfully combines Stephen King with Donna Tartt, plus a twist of Shirley Jackson, in this timely tale of a man, his new partner, and his old dog.</b><BR><BR>When he was a boy, it was just him and his mother, and when he was an adult, it was just him, alone. Michael Corcoran thought it would always be that way.<BR> <BR>Then he&rsquo;d met Tina, who didn&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;d never had friends, or what kinds of &ldquo;experiments&rdquo; he liked to do in his lab in the garage as a boy. Instead of being alone, Michael had a wife, and children and, eventually, a dog. <BR> <BR>Michael had promised himself he wasn&rsquo;t going to be one of those people who pushed their dogs in carriages and called them &ldquo;fur babies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just wait,&rdquo; Tina said&#8212;and soon enough, Lady was enjoying premium kibble and wearing a tiny Eagles jersey, plus special booties for the snow. He and Tina even developed a voice for Lady, a routine: a low, gruff, cigarettes-and whiskey tone that went with the tragic backstory they gave her.<BR> <BR>Then Tina found a lump in her breast. And then she was gone. And then small, determined Suzanne Nelson dropped by Michael&rsquo;s newly empty apartment with some homemade lasagna and never left. The transition would&rsquo;ve gone smoothly if not for Lady&#8212;and the lisping, babyish falsetto Suzanne used when she &ldquo;talked&rdquo; as the dog.<BR> <BR>Michael asked her to stop. And Suzanne did her best. But some things people can&rsquo;t change, no matter how they try, like how they sound, and who they love&#8212;and who they are, in the wee small hours, when it&rsquo;s dark and no one&rsquo;s watching.]]></Text>

Cozier than a hand-knit gray cardigan and richer than Abuela&rsquo;s pastelito recipe, Namey takes you from Miami to Winchester, and leaves your heart belonging to both.&rdquo; &#8212;Rachael Lippincott, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Five Feet Apart</i></b><BR> <BR><b><i>Love & Gelato</i> meets <i>Don&rsquo;t Date Rosa Santos</i> in this charming, heartfelt story following a Miami girl who unexpectedly finds love&#8212;and herself&#8212;in a small English town.</b><BR><BR>For Lila Reyes, a summer in England was never part of the plan. The plan was 1) take over her abuela&rsquo;s role as head baker at their panader&#237;a, 2) move in with her best friend after graduation, and 3) live happily ever after with her boyfriend. But then the Trifecta happened, and everything&#8212;including Lila herself&#8212;fell apart.<BR> <BR>Worried about Lila&rsquo;s mental health, her parents make a new plan for her: Spend three months with family friends in Winchester, England, to relax and reset. But with the lack of sun, a grumpy inn cook, and a small town lacking Miami flavor (both in food and otherwise), what would be a dream trip for some feels more like a nightmare to Lila&hellip;until she meets Orion Maxwell.<BR> <BR>A teashop clerk with troubles of his own, Orion is determined to help Lila out of her funk, and appoints himself as her personal tour guide. From Winchester&rsquo;s drama-filled music scene to the sweeping English countryside, it isn&rsquo;t long before Lila is not only charmed by Orion, but England itself. Soon a new future is beginning to form in Lila&rsquo;s mind&#8212;one that would mean leaving everything she ever planned behind.]]></Text>

When devastating events leave Lila reeling after high school graduation, her parents have her stay with family in England for the summer. Lila is comforted when she infuses Miami flavors from home into her cousin&#39;s kitchen. She embraces friendships with Orion, a neighboring tea shop clerk, and his friends. But what happens to these connections once it&#39;s time for Lila to go home? . . . A formal British accent enhances Orion&#39;s charm and showcases cultural differences. Corzo&#39;s voice fades out while delivering unfinished sentences as Lila and Orion determine their relationship status, emphasizing the difficulty of the situation.&quot;]]></Text>

Once a rising star following in her mother&rsquo;s footsteps, she&rsquo;s now an administrative assistant at an insurance agency&#8212;or so they think.<BR> <BR>In reality, Brinkley works at Heartbreak for Hire, a secret service that specializes in revenge for jilted lovers, frenemies, and long-suffering coworkers with a little cash to spare and a man who needs to be taken down a notch. It might not be as prestigious as academia, but it helps Brinkley save for her dream of opening an art gallery and lets her exorcise a few demons, all while helping to empower women.<BR> <BR>But when her boss announces she&rsquo;s hiring <i>male</i> heartbreakers for the first time, Brinkley&rsquo;s no longer so sure she&rsquo;s doing the right thing&#8212;especially when her new coworker turns out to be a target she was paid to take down. Though Mark spends his days struggling up the academic ladder, he seems to be the opposite of a backstabbing adjunct: a nerd at heart in criminally sexy sweater vests who&rsquo;s attentive both in and out of the bedroom. But as Brinkley finds it increasingly more difficult to focus on anything but Mark, she soon realizes that like herself, people aren&rsquo;t always who they appear to be.<BR> <BR>With Sonia Hartl&rsquo;s &ldquo;bitingly funny&rdquo; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) prose, <i>Heartbreak for Hire </i>is a clever romcom you and your girlfriends won&rsquo;t be able to stop talking about.]]></Text>

      <Text><![CDATA[<b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kathy Reichs returns with her twentieth gripping novel featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan, whose examinations, fifteen years apart, of unidentified bodies washed up from the sea may be connected to a deadly new pestilence.</b><BR><BR>A storm has hit South Carolina, dredging up crimes of the past.<BR> <BR>En route to Isle of Palms, a barrier island off the South Carolina coast, forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan receives a call from the Charleston coroner. During the storm, a medical waste container has washed up on the beach. Inside are two decomposed bodies wrapped in plastic sheeting and bound with electrical wire. Chillingly, Tempe recognizes many details as identical to those of an unsolved case she handled in Quebec fifteen earlier. With a growing sense of foreboding, she flies to Montreal to gather evidence and convince her boss Pierre LaManch to reopen the cold case. She also seeks the advice&#8212;and comfort&#8212;of her longtime beau Andrew Ryan.<BR> <BR>Meanwhile, a storm of a different type gathers force in South Carolina. The citizens of Charleston are struck by capnocytophaga, a bacterium that, at its worst, can eat human flesh. Thousands panic and test themselves for a rare genetic mutation that may have rendered them vulnerable.<BR> <BR>Shockingly, Tempe eventually deduces not only that the victims in both grisly murder cases are related, but that the murders and the disease outbreak also have a common cause.]]></Text>
